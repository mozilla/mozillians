    <p>
      Mozillians are people who volunteer their time to advance the Mozilla
      mission. They're dedicated to promoting openness, innovation and
      opportunity on the Web and they form the core of our community.
    </p>
    <p>
      This directory is a resource to make it easy for Mozillians to learn who
      is involved, what they do and how to connect with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Want to find Mozillians in Auckland for a meetup? Need an expert XPCOM
      hacker to review a patch? That's exactly what this site is for.

        Privacy has been an important part of this directory from the very
        beginning. We want to make sure we provide Mozillians with the best
        experience possible, from the way the site is built to the way we
        vouch for new users before they can access data that should only be
        available to other Mozillians. Read our
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/{{ locale }}/privacy-policy.html">
