# DIT Content Rule for inetOrgPerson (2.16.840.1.113730.3.2.2)
#
# Prevent unwanted objectclasses on user entries
#
# This is a belt-and-braces protection as normally only the registration agent
# and LDAP admins can change the objectClass attribute
#
# We also make both uid and uniqueIdentifier mandatory:
#    uid is the username, so it is essential for the user to locate their entry
#    uniqueIdentifier is the naming attribute
#
# Note that because this is part of the schema, even the rootDN cannot break the rules
